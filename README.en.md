Looking to capture those epic highlights from your livestreams? Look no further! Highlight-Hotkeyer is here to save the day. ðŸŽ®ðŸ’¥

This nifty program is designed to assist streamers in effortlessly saving their most memorable moments during livestreams. With just a simple keystroke, you can mark those epic moments and create a timestamped record for easy access later on.

**How it works:**   
- The script generates a new file named [day]-[month]-[year] when run for the first time.
- If the file already exists, it appends the current stream's minute to the existing file.

So, when it's time to gather all the hilarious moments from your stream, you can easily navigate to the timestamps within the corresponding stream file.

**File Format:**      
Start Time: hour:minute:second

Moments:  
- hour:minute:second  
- hour:minute:second  
- hour:minute:second  
- hour:minute:second  
...

Capture those amazing highlights and create memorable content for your audience! ðŸŽ¥âœ¨
